# OpenCart Automation 🚀

## Overview

OpenCart Automation is a test automation framework designed for testing OpenCart applications. This project uses Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG or JUnit, Maven, and other tools to ensure comprehensive and efficient testing of OpenCart functionalities.

## Project Structure 🗂️

- `src/main/java/`: Contains the main source code for page objects and base classes.
- `src/test/java/`: Contains test classes and test suites.
- `resources/`: Contains configuration files and test data.
- `test-output/`: Contains reports generated by TestNG or JUnit.
- `Docker/`: Contains Docker-related files for containerizing the test environment.
- `browserstack_videos/`: Contains video recordings of test executions on BrowserStack.
- `Git/`: Contains Git-related files, including `.gitignore`.

## Features ✨

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements POM for maintainable and reusable page objects.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Uses Excel files or other data sources for data-driven test cases.
- **Custom Logging**: Includes custom logging for better debugging and traceability.
- **Failure Screenshots**: Captures screenshots on test failures for easier debugging.
- **Docker Integration**: Provides Docker configuration for containerized test environments.
- **BrowserStack Integration**: Supports running tests on BrowserStack with video recordings.

## TestRunner Configuration ⚙️

The `TestRunner` is configured to handle test execution in different environments using XML files:

- **`remote.xml`**: This configuration file is used for running tests on remote servers or cloud-based environments. It specifies the necessary settings and capabilities to connect to a remote WebDriver instance, ensuring that tests can be executed on a remote machine or cloud service like BrowserStack. 🌐

- **`local.xml`**: This file is used for running tests on a local machine. It contains configurations for setting up a local WebDriver instance, which is useful for development and debugging purposes. It specifies browser options and other local settings required for executing tests on your local environment. 🖥️

- **`browserstack.xml`**: This configuration file is specifically for running tests on BrowserStack. It includes settings for connecting to BrowserStack’s cloud-based testing infrastructure, allowing tests to be executed across various browsers and operating systems provided by BrowserStack. The file typically includes BrowserStack credentials and desired capabilities for the test environment. 🌍

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher ☕
- Apache Maven 🔧
- Docker (optional, for containerized testing) 🐳
- BrowserStack credentials (optional, for BrowserStack integration) 🌐

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManojBasavaiah/OpenCartAutomation.git
   cd OpenCartAutomation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

### Running Tests

- To run tests locally:
  ```bash
  mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=local.xml
  ```

- To run tests on BrowserStack:
  ```bash
  mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=browserstack.xml
  ```

- To run tests on a remote server:
  ```bash
  mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=remote.xml
  ```

### Docker

To build and run the Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t opencart-automation .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it opencart-automation
   ```

### BrowserStack Integration

To run tests on BrowserStack, ensure your BrowserStack credentials are set in the `config.properties` file. Update the `browserstack` configuration as needed.
